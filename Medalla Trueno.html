    <p>         Peel potatoes, slice lengthwise in half, and steam for 15 minutes until just tender. Remove and set aside to cool. Melt butter in a large skillet. Add cooking oil and heat until just beginning to bubble. Add potatoes, diced onions, red bell pepper, garlic, herbs and seasonings. Saute for 5 - 8 minutes or until potatoes begin to brown.

When done, drizzle with fresh lemon juice, garnish with green onions, and serve immediately. </p>
